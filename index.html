ENGINEER, SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT

At Dotlines, I work as a full-time Laravel developer focused on building full-stack applications with Vue.js
on the frontend and Laravel on the backend. Iâ€™ve contributed to multiple production-level projects,
including enterprise systems, mobile apps, and real-time integrations.

One of my major projects was the Agrani Bank Remittance App, a cross-platform remittance solution. I
developed secure RESTful APIs in Laravel for managing remitters, beneficiaries, and transactions. The
frontend was built using Vue.js, where I transformed static interfaces into dynamic, interactive
components. The application supports real-time exchange rate updates, dynamic fee calculation, multi-
language features, and automated PDF receipt generation. I integrated the FPX payment gateway for
online transactions and handled SMS/email notifications using Laravel Jobs and Queues. I created an
admin panel on the backend using Laravel Admin to manage users, system settings, and remittance data.
A key part of my work involved integrating with external remittance services via XML over REST using
Guzzle, ensuring secure and reliable data synchronization.

Another project was the Blood Donation App, where I designed and implemented a full-stack donor
management system. I built modules for donor registration, live donor search, and donation history
tracking. The system includes a mobile version built using Capacitor to enable access across Android
devices. I also developed a dynamic dashboard and an admin panel using Laravel Admin to manage
donors and their records. Frontend and backend communicate via secure custom REST APIs.

I also developed a Loyalty Program Poject where organizations can register, onboard customers, and
manage loyalty tiers. The application handles automatic customer category updates based on
transactional behavior, supported by a Laravel-based notification system. I built the frontend using
Laravel Blade and managed the backend with Laravelâ€™s Eloquent ORM.

INTERN, AUTOMATION TEAM, TECHNOLOGY DIVISION

During my internship at BRAC Bank, I worked in the Automation Team where I
used Python (with Selenium and PyAutoGUI) to automate various internal banking
processes. One of my notable contributions involved using computer vision to
extract passport-size photos and signatures from scanned credit card application
forms (PDF and TIF formats). This automation helped reduce manual processing
and improved turnaround time for form handling. I also collaborated with the IT
department to validate automation workflows and ensure smooth handover for
production deployment.
